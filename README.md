# UnderstandingTheNeuralCode

With this repo i want to share my knowledge about minning massive datasets that exists in our connectom.

1. What is the human Connectom ?

A connectome is a comprehensive map of neural connections in the brain, and may be thought of as its "wiring diagram". More broadly, a connectome would include the mapping of all neural connections within an organism's nervous system.

How to use the blue print architecture of the brain for predective analysis.
